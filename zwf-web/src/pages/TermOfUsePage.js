    <h1>Pricing</h1>
    <p>If you are not currently on a free trial or promotional period, you will need to pay for a subscription based on the pricing of the plan you choose. The pricing details and other terms of your subscription will be explained when you select your plan.</p>
    <p>During a free trial period, you can use our services at no cost according to the terms specified at the time of sign up. If you choose to continue using our services after the trial, you will be billed when you add your billing details into our services, as detailed in the pricing plan and on Pricing Page. If you choose not to continue using our services after a trial, you may delete your organization.</p>
    <p>To use our services, you will generally need to pay a monthly subscription fee based on your subscription type (the subscription fee). The pricing plan includes the subscription and subscription fees we offer, as well as invoicing, payment, auto-renewal, and cancellation terms. The pricing plan may vary by region and includes information set out in the offer details and pricing page. We may update or amend the pricing plan from time to time, and changes will not apply retrospectively. If we make changes and you are a subscriber, we will make every effort to notify you. Depending on your region, subscription fees may be inclusive or exclusive of transactional taxes where relevant (such as VAT and GST), as reflected in the pricing plan.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for paying all external fees and taxes associated with your use of our services, including withholding tax if applicable, unless we already process that withholding tax. We may collect geographical location information to determine your location, which may be used for tax purposes. Your location information must be accurate for tax residency purposes.</p>
    <p>To continue accessing our services, you must make timely payments based on the pricing plan you selected. To avoid delayed or missed payments, please ensure that we have accurate payment information. Failure to make timely payments may result in the suspension of access to your subscription until the payment is made.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Termination of subscription</h1>
    <p>Your subscription will be terminated with a one-month notice period. Once you have canceled your subscription, it cannot be reversed, and all of your personally identifiable information (PII data) will be permanently deleted. However, we may keep certain information such as task and form templates, document templates, messages, and other clients' usage data for tracking purposes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Data Use and Privacy</h1>
    <p>ZeeWorkflow utilizes your data to provide our services to you. Our privacy notice is a critical component of these terms and provides more details about how we handle personal data, such as your name and email address.</p>
    <p>Use of Data: We do not own the data you enter or upload into our services, but you grant us a license to use, copy, transmit, store, analyze, and back up all data you submit to us through our services, including personal data of yourself and others. We use this data to enable you to use our services, improve, develop, and protect our services, create new services, communicate with you about your subscription, send you information based on your marketing preferences, and disclose to third-party service providers and partners to support these purposes.</p>
    <p>Use of Your Personal Data: We take data protection seriously and respect your privacy. In addition to these terms, our privacy notice details how we process your personal data that you enter into ZeeWorkflow, such as your name and email address.</p>
    <p>Use of Personal Data About Others: Our data processing terms may apply to the personal data of others (such as your customers, suppliers, and employees) that you enter into ZeeWorkflow, depending on their location.</p>
    <p>Anonymized Statistical Data: We may create anonymized statistical data from your data and usage of our services, including through aggregation. Once anonymized, we may use it for our own purposes, such as providing and improving our services, developing new services or products, identifying business trends, and communicating with you about these uses.</p>
    <p>Data Breach Notifications: If there has been unauthorized access to personal data that you have entered into ZeeWorkflow, we will inform you and, where possible, provide information about what has happened. Depending on the nature of the unauthorized access and the location of your affected contacts, you may need to determine whether the unauthorized access must be reported to the contact and/or a relevant authority.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Confidential Information</h1>
    <p>We take reasonable precautions to safeguard your confidential information and expect you to do the same for ours.</p>
    <p>Keeping It Confidential: While using our services, you may share confidential information with us, and you may become aware of confidential information about us. We both agree to take reasonable measures to protect each other's confidential information from unauthorized access. We may share each other's confidential information with legal or regulatory authorities if required to do so.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Subscription Terms and Termination</h1>
    <p>Your subscription will continue for the period covered by the subscription fee paid or payable. At the end of each billing period, these terms will automatically continue for another period of the same duration as the previous one, provided that you continue to pay the subscription fee in accordance with the pricing plan. If you wish to terminate your subscription, you may do so at any time by providing one month's written notice in advance. You will still be required to pay all relevant subscription fees up to and including the day of termination.</p>
    <p>ZeeWorkflow may choose to terminate your subscription at any time by providing you with TWO Weeks’ written notice in advance. ZeeWorkflow may also terminate or suspend your subscription or access to all or any data immediately if you violate any of these terms, fail to pay subscription fees, or if you or your business become insolvent.</p>
    <p>No refunds will be issued if you terminate your subscription or if ZeeWorkflow terminates it in accordance with these terms.</p>
    <p>Once your subscription is terminated, your data will be archived and no longer available to you. We retain it for a period of time consistent with our data retention policy, during which you can reactivate your subscription and regain access to your data by paying the subscription fees. We retain data in case you need it as part of your record retention obligations, but you can contact us to have your data completely removed if you wish.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Liability and Indemnity</h1>
    <p>You indemnify us against all losses, costs (including legal costs), expenses, demands, or liability that we incur arising out of, or in connection with, a third-party claim against us relating to your use of our services or any third-party product.</p>
    <p>Our services and all third-party products are made available to you on an "as is" basis. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including any implied warranties of non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, subject to the exclusion in section 57.</p>
    <p>Our liability to you in connection with our services or these terms, in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, is limited. We have no liability for any loss of revenue or profit, loss of goodwill, loss of customers, legal, tax or accounting compliance issues, damage to reputation, loss in connection with any other contract, or indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special loss, damage, or expense. For loss or corruption of your data, our liability will be limited to taking reasonable steps to try and recover that data from our available backups. Our total aggregate liability to you in any circumstances is limited to the total amount you paid us for your subscription in the 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the claim giving rise to the liability arose.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Dispute Resolution</h1>
    <p>If you have any concerns, please contact our support team. If we are unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction, or if we haven't been able to resolve a dispute we have with you after attempting to do so informally, you and we agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Any dispute must be brought in the parties' individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Additional Terms</h1>
    <p>Professional Advice: Please note that ZeeWorkflow is not a professional services firm and does not provide any professional advice. We may offer information that we believe may be helpful in running an accounting firm, but this information is not a substitute for professional advice. We are not responsible for any use you make of this information.</p>
    <p>Events Beyond Our Control: We make every effort to manage the controllable aspects of our services. However, we are not liable for any failure or delay in performance of our obligations under these terms due to any event or circumstance outside our reasonable control.</p>
    <p>Notices: If you need to send a notice to ZeeWorkflow, please email info@zeeworkflow.com. We will send any notices to you at the email address you have provided during your subscription.</p>
    <p>Non-excludable Guarantees: In some places, there may be non-excludable warranties, guarantees or other rights provided by law (non-excludable guarantees). These guarantees still apply, and these terms do not exclude, restrict, or modify them. Except for non-excludable guarantees and other rights that we cannot exclude, we are bound only by the express promises made in these terms. Our liability for a breach of a non-excludable guarantee is limited, at our option, to either replacing or paying for the cost of replacing the relevant service (unless the non-excludable guarantee says otherwise).</p>
    <p>Export Limitations: You must not use our services in violation of any export or trade embargo laws that apply to you.</p>
    <p>Excluded Terms: These terms do not apply to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods or the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA).</p>
    <p>Blocking Access or Subscription: As our services are global, different laws may apply in different countries, and we may need to block access or terminate subscriptions or refuse to process payments in certain situations. For example, we may take these actions if we reasonably believe that there is a risk associated with you, your company, your subscription, or a payment. This may include transactions where the payment is from a sanctioned person or country or where we believe there is a legal or regulatory risk or a risk of loss for us, our customers or partners. You confirm that you are not located in a sanctioned country and are not on a sanctioned persons list. We may also block users from a country if we cannot receive payments from that country. We reserve the right to take any of these actions without notice.</p>
    <p>Relationship between the Parties; Assignment: These terms do not constitute a partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship between you and us or between you and any other subscriber or invited user. You are solely responsible for resolving disputes between you and any other subscriber or invited user.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Changes to These Terms&nbsp;</h1>
    <p>We may change these terms of use from time to time, but any changes will not apply retrospectively. We will make every effort to inform you of any changes and generally provide notice before material changes become effective, unless we need to make immediate changes due to reasons beyond our control. We will notify you of changes by email or by posting a visible notice through our services. If a change is not material, we may not notify you. If you find a modified term unacceptable, you may terminate your subscription by providing the standard advance notice to ZeeWorkflow.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Enforcement of Terms</h1>
    <p>In the event that any provision of these terms cannot be enforced by either party, such provision shall be disregarded while all other provisions remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <p>Words such as "include" and "including" do not imply any limitations, and when a matter is subject to our discretion, it means that we have the sole discretion to decide.</p>

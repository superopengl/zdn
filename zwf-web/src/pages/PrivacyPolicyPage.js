    <h1>General Information</h1>
    <p>At Zeeworkflow, we are committed to keeping your information safe and secure. We collect data to improve and personalize our services, and we respect your privacy. We use various technologies, such as cookies and error reports, to record how you interact with our services. We may also obtain data from third parties to supplement what we collect. The information we collect depends on the features you use. We use your information for three purposes: to operate and improve our services, to send communications, and to support your use of the Zeeworkflow software. We share your information only with your consent or as necessary to complete transactions or provide services you have requested. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf, subject to our data privacy and security requirements. You can manage your personal data online and choose whether to receive promotional communications from us. Our service is hosted on Amazon, which has data centers worldwide. We take precautions to protect your data, no matter where it is stored.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1><span><strong>Zeeworkflow Pty Ltd, </strong></span><span>Zeeworkflow</span><span><strong> ‘us’, and ‘you’</strong></span></h1>
    <p>Refers to itself as 'we', 'us', and 'our'. The users, subscribers, or viewers of the Zeeworkflow software, websites, or other related services are referred to as 'you'. The company warns of potential risks involved in the use of the internet, including external websites and sources. The data collected by the company includes direct data provided by users, data obtained through interactions with the service, and data obtained from third parties. The data collected is used to operate the business and provide personalized services, to send communications and promotional materials, and to support users in their use of the service. The data may be shared with third-party providers, affiliates, subsidiaries, and vendors or agents working on behalf of the company. The company provides options for users to view and edit their personal data and choose whether they wish to receive promotional communications. The data may be stored in multiple locations worldwide, but the company has safeguards in place to protect it. The company retains the data for the duration of any active subscription or relationship with the user and for a period afterwards. Users have the right to access, correct, and delete their personal data.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1><strong>Risks to you Personal Information</strong></h1>
    <p>While Zeeworkflow Pty Ltd takes every measure to ensure the security and privacy of personal data and to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, corruption or destruction, we would like to caution our users that not all risks related to the use of the Internet can be fully controlled. Please note that Zeeworklow and any related documentation or correspondence may contain links to other websites or sources outside of our control. We cannot be held responsible for the provision, display, content, advertising, products, services or any other material available on or from these external sources.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1><span><strong>Information We Collect</strong></span></h1>
    <p>At Zeeworkflow, we gather data to ensure optimal functionality and provide you with a seamless experience. Some of this data is supplied directly by you, such as when you request a trial, subscribe to our services, or input information into the application. Other data is collected through the use of technologies like cookies and by analyzing your interaction with our services, including error reports and usage data from software on your device. We may also obtain data from third-party sources, such as demographic data purchased from other companies. Additionally, we use location-based services from external sources to customize certain features based on your IP address. The data we collect is dependent on the particular services and features you use.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1><strong>How we use your information</strong></h1>
    <p>We have three primary objectives for the data we collect: to effectively operate our business and offer services (including personalization and improvement), which may involve sharing data with our third-party providers, to send communications (including marketing communications), and to assist you in your use of the Zeeworkflow software. To provide you with a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, we integrate data we collect from the various web services you use. However, we have implemented technological and procedural safeguards to protect privacy and prevent certain data combinations. For instance, we store data we collect from unauthenticated users (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies them, such as their name, email, or phone number.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1><span><strong>Sharing Your Information</strong></span></h1>
    <p>We only share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to fulfill any transaction or provide the services you have requested or authorized. For instance, we share your content with third parties only when you explicitly instruct us to do so. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we share it with banks and other entities involved in processing payment transactions, providing financial services, and preventing fraud and credit risks.</p>
    <p>We may also share personal data with our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries for the purposes outlined in this statement. Additionally, we may share personal data with vendors or agents who work on our behalf, such as companies providing customer service support or assisting us in protecting and securing our systems and services. However, these companies must comply with our data privacy and security requirements and are prohibited from using personal data received from us for any other purpose.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, we may disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger or sale of assets.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1><span><strong>Management of Personal Data and Communications</strong></span></h1>
    <p>Accessing and managing your personal data is possible through our online services. The options available to you for controlling or accessing your personal data may vary depending on the Zeeworkflow services you use. You have the option to opt-out of receiving promotional communications from us via email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive any promotional emails or SMS messages from us and wish to opt-out, you can follow the instructions provided in the message. Please note that these choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are essential for billing or core Zeeworkflow services.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1><span><strong>International Data Storage</strong></span></h1>
    <p>Zeeworkflow is hosted on Amazon, a global provider of online services with data centers located worldwide. Your data will primarily be stored in a location within the same region as you for performance, regulatory, and security purposes. However, it is possible for backups and traces of your data to be stored in other regions. We and Microsoft have implemented safeguards to protect your data in any location where it is stored. We make every effort to ensure that your data remains in secure locations that we trust and control at all times.</p>
